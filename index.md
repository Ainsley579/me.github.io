## About Me

I am Shiyi LIU (刘诗逸), currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence(SCAI)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I am now working at the [VADER lab](https://vader.lab.asu.edu/#/) under the supervision of [Prof.Ross Maciejewski](https://rmaciejewski.faculty.asu.edu/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) and Master's degree in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University.

## Research Interests 
My research interests lie in data visualization (VIS) and human computer interaction (HCI). My task is to study how people understand AI, focusing on the trust and perception issues. By examining these elements, my goal is to identify key factors that enhance or impair user trust and to develop more intuitive and effective interaction models between humans and AI systems.
